  <p><strong>HTML Intro</strong></p>
This lesson is a refresher on what I had previously learned several years ago.

HTML makes creating web pages a lot more simplier and fun once you get the hang of the basics elements.

<p><strong>Structure</p></strong>
The major pieces are the user, the internet, servers, and language spoken
So how do these pieces come together?
<p>The user interact with the internet via a machine (laptop, tablet, etc) utilizing a particular browser such as IE, Firefox, etc.
The transportation or mechanism that allows for the communication from the user to the world is the internet.
The internet is comprised of several powerful machines communicating to the users via a language or protocol called HTTP. It is also used in the communication between the user and the internet as well.
Building a webpage to be displayed for the world to see, requires learning about some basic elements of HTML and the web.</p>
For instance, there is a tag which is a html identifer that is contained in language written to the computer. Secondary to the tag, is another piece called the element. The element is the content of 'things' that is contained in the opening and closing of a tag.
Finally, there is the attribute. It is an identifer that specify an element.

<p>Another interesting piece is the description of an HTML document and its structure. There is the heading and body of the HTML. A resembleance to writing a book or a story - opening, body and closing.
This is much easier and user friendly than inputting pages of code and trying to debug where the errors are. As you write a HTML doc, one must remember that you are writing a language that must be very specific so that the computer can accurately understand it. Missed a tag or poorly written element can result in confusion by the computer and frustration on your part. HTML is the language it speaks. It's best to be learn it quite well.</p>
